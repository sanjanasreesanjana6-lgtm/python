**SCOPE IS USED TO KNOW HOW WE CAN ACCESS THE VARIABLES IN FUNCTIONS 
**THIS CAN BE DONE BY USING THE "LEGB"RULE

**LOCAL SCOPE**

def sanjana():
   my_var="local scope"
   print(my_var)
sanjana()
-----
//local scope 

def sanjana():
   my_var="local scope"
   print(my_var)
sanjana()   
print(my_var)
------
//local scope 
error//throws error because my_var variable is declared locally it can't be accessed explicitly 


**ENCLOSED SCOPE**


def sanjana():
   my_var="local scope"
   print(my_var)
   def study():
        my_var2="enclosed scope"
        print(my_var2)
sanjana()
------
//local scope//because we called only sanjana function not the study function


def sanjana():
   my_var="local scope"
  
   def study():
        print(my_var)
   study()

sanjana()
------
//local scope//this is how we can access the inner & outer functions

def sanjana():
   my_var="local scope"
   print(my_var2)
  
   def study():
       my_var2="enclosed scope"
        print(my_var)
   study()

sanjana()
------
//this throws an because we are trying to print the my_var2 in sanjana function without the variable declaration,which is declared in the study function
//above code is also same type but it is declared the variable first before the print statement
//to overcome this we have do the following steps


def sanjana():
   my_var="local scope"
   my_var2=""//we have create a empty variable 
  
   def study():
       nonlocal my_var2//nonlocal is used allow the modification 
       my_var2="enclosed scope"
       print(my_var)
   study()
   print(my_var2)//prints the value of my_var2
sanjana()
------
local scope
enclosed scope
